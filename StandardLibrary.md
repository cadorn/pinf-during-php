# Introduction #

The PINF Standard Library (PINFSL) provides useful additions to the [Standard PHP Library](http://www.phpro.org/tutorials/Introduction-to-SPL.html) and [PHP Functions](http://us2.php.net/manual/en/funcref.php).

It is widely compatible just like PHP itself and is collectively maintained just like PHP.
