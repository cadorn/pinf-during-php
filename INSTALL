Development Setup
-----------------

This package can only be used in a development setting at this time. Once ZendFramework
version 1.8.0 is released on pear.zfcampus.org we can work on deployment packaging.

To setup development environment for PINF run:

	bootstrap.sh

For detailed development setup info see:
