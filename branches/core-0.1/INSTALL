Development Setup
-----------------

This package can only be used in a development setting at this time. Once ZendFramework
version 1.8.0 is released on pear.zfcampus.org we can work on deployment packaging.

To setup your development environment for PINF run:

	bootstrap.sh
	Run with --help to print usage message.
	
To update your development environment simply re-run bootstrap.sh. On occasion the SVN paths
and versions to some of the integrated tools will change. In these cases you will need to run:

  bootstrap.sh clean all

For detailed development setup info see:
