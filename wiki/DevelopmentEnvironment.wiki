{{{
bootstrap.sh

Run with --help to print usage message.

The bootstrap script will:

  * Install [Phing]
  * Install [PEAR:VersionControl_SVN]
  * Checkout source copies of [Phing], [ZendFramework] and [PHPUnit] into _./build/pear_
  * Build and publish development bootstrap files for PINF into _./build/pear/pinf_
  * Install _./build/pear/pinf/package.xml_ using your default PEAR installer

To update your development environment simply re-run bootstrap.sh. On occasion the SVN paths and versions to some of the integrated tools will change. In these cases you will need to run:

{{{
bootstrap.sh clean all
}}}
